# Description
Haalia is a vast empire, officially ruled by the **Emperor**.
All the day-to-day running of the country is done by a **Small Council**, which is formed through an election from the various constituencies, some of which were previously kingdoms in their own right. Now it's all a part of one big and _happy_ empire.

All Prime Council decisions are challenged by the **Commons Council** - a non-governing entity, representing the people of the empire. All the big decisions go through the **High Council** for analysis and approval before arriving on the **Emperor**'s desk.

Towns are controlled by local mayors, sometimes leading what is known as a town planning council if the city is large enough. Usually, the mayor is hired by the small council member representing the city's constituency.  

Haalia spans several climatic zones, mostly lying in temperate climates. Northern parts are less populated where temperate climates and forests give way to vast tundras.

While middle population does regular farming and sits on one of the main world trade routes, the southern population enjoys a warmer climate and sea proximity, growing fruit and making wines, trying to compete with the neighboring **Vanam Sillae**. 

Haalia is the center of technological and magical advancement - magical tech (**Arcana Mirantes**) properly created after **The War Of Mages** is mainly situated there, as well as the **Arcane Congress**.
